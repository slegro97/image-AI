# image-AI
This project used MobileNetV2 with the ImageAI library to classify images into the top five predicted categories. The model was pre-trained on a large dataset, enabling efficient and accurate image classification.

Key steps include:

- Model Setup: Leveraged the MobileNetV2 architecture for lightweight image classification.
- Data Inference: Used ImageAI's classifyImage method to classify new images and output predictions with probabilities.
- Pre-trained Model: Applied transfer learning to rapidly classify new images without retraining the model from scratch.

This project showcases my ability to work with pre-trained models, perform image classification, and efficiently apply transfer learning for real-time predictions.
